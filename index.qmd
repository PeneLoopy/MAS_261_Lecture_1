I grew up here and went to SU and 

- then I ...

  - worked in Scotland, Slovakia, Lithuania, Chile.
  - traveled all over…
  - went to graduate school in Oregon and Virginia.
  - worked in federal gov’t and private sector. 

- Now I ...

  - still do consulting and some research in analytics.
  - also helped create the Business Analytics major here at Whitman.

## Using R and RStudio :magic_wand:

::: {.incremental}
- You have two options to facilitate your introduction to R and RStudio:

  - **Option 1:** Download and Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) on your laptop.
  - **Option 2:** Start with a free [Posit Cloud account](https://posit.cloud/) and then transition to Option 1.

<br/>

- **If you are comfortable with coding:** Start with Option 1, but still sign up for Posit Cloud account.
- **If you are nervous about coding:** Choose Option 2.
- **For both options:** I can help with download/install issues during office hours.

<br/>
  
- **What I do:** I maintain a Posit Cloud account for helping students but I do most of my work on my laptop.

## What is Statistics, Analytics, etc.? :chart_with_upwards_trend:

- Statistics (the discipline) allows us to answer questions about (almost) anything we want to know that we can collect data for.

::: columns

::: {.column width="70%"}

  - We start with a **POPULATION** that we have a question about. 
  
  - We select a subset from that population, called a **SAMPLE**.
  
  - We collect data from the **SAMPLE** and summarize it, to get an **ESTIMATE**.
  
  - That **ESTIMATE** answers our question about our **POPULATION**.

## Statistics, Analytics, Data Science...huh :question:

- [**Statistics**]{style="color: tomato"} is a discipline (what we study) and [**a statistic**]{style="color: tomato"} is an estimate based on data.

  - This dual meaning confuses people.

  - A newer term to describe the discipline of organizing, analyzing, and presenting data is [**Analytics**]{style="color: tomato"} .

- How do these terms, Statistics and Analytics, differ?

  - It depends on who you are talking to.
  - Analytics (like the new Business Analytics major at Whitman) is the more modern term.
  - Another (overlapping) term is Data Science which is similar but more encompassing.

- Why so many terms? [**Good Question!**]{style="color: tomato"} 

- [**My Opinion:**]{style="color: tomato"} People are unsure about this field and its methods which leads to confusion.

## Where do YOU fit in to Statistics and Analytics :question:

- Data, statistics, and analytics are essential to everyday life.

  - This is especially true for management and business professionals.
  - Understanding the pandemic, politics, sports, weather, investments, all require data skills.

- Where you (students) are needed: 

  - You are needed to understand data and communicate statistical information correctly and honestly to your peers, and the world at large.
  
- Before you ask...

  - Yes, you could google [**How do I communicate statistics?**]{style="color: tomato"} 
  - Yes you could write a related  question in [**ChatGPT**]{style="color: tomato"}  
  - This class will provide tools and information that those searches don't provide.
  - More to come on how to use [**ChatGPT**]{style="color: tomato"} effectively and ethically.

## What percent of people in each county in the United States have a Bachelor's degree?

::: columns

::: {.column width="70%"}

- The [**POPULATION**]{style="color: tomato"} is all people the USA.  

- Within that population, we have a [**SUBPOPULATION**]{style="color: tomato"} for each county.

- To answer this question, **should we talk to EVERY person in every county**?

  - [**NO!**]{style="color: tomato"} Instead, the [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) uses an [established sample design](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/design-and-methodology.html) to attain representative data from each county.
  
  - The [**SAMPLE**]{style="color: tomato"} is the group of people SELECTED in each county who complete the survey.
  
  - The [**ESTIMATES**]{style="color: tomato"} from each county's [**SAMPLE**]{style="color: tomato"} represent that county's [**POPULATION**]{style="color: tomato"}.
